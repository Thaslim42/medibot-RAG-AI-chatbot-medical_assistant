your medical ai assistent

This project is a Medical Chatbot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for intelligent, context-aware responses. It integrates multiple technologies to provide an AI-driven solution that allows users to interact with a chatbot for medical-related queries. The chatbot leverages a combination of Flask, Groq hardware acceleration, and Pinecone vector search to deliver efficient and accurate responses. The system is designed to process medical documents, extract key information, and provide personalized answers to user queries based on retrieved documents.
